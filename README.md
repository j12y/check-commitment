# Check Commit(ment)

Basic premise is to look at a GitHub repository and see which forks of a
popular repository have active development and work-in-progress.

## Use Case: #100DaysOfCode

Take the #100DaysOfCode repository and generate a report to help understand
some aggregate statistics on who commits to the project and how likely they are
to make it to the full 100 Days.

## Use Case: Open-Source Project

You have an enthusiastic community wanting to contribute to a project, how
likely are they to follow-through and can we predict when changes will be ready
based on commit trends in their fork to help with roadmaps.
